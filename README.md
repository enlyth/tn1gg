TN1.gg landing page, built with NextJS and TailwindCSS.

For now, it is a completely static page so we use the undocumented `unstable_runtimeJS` feature to exclude any runtime javascript.

## Getting started

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
# or
yarn
yarn dev
```

## Building for production

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

Build by running `npm run build` or `yarn build`
